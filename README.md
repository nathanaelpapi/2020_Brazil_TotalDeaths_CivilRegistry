# Data on total deaths in 2020 in Brazil.

This is some data wrangling in datasets provided by @capyvara (https://github.com/capyvara/brazil-civil-registry-data) that are raw scrapings from the Brazilian Civil Registry Data (https://transparencia.registrocivil.org.br/).


The best source for death statistics in Brazil is SIM - Mortality Information System, but this repository is not fully updated with the latest data for 2020. Although more inaccurate and less consolidated than SIM, civil registry numbers can be useful for research at this time, while SIM is not updated.

The datasets presented here are intended to organize data on total deaths in 2020, organized by date and epidemiological week, as well as grouped by sex and age groups.
